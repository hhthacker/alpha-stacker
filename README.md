# NSS Static-Web Exercise: Alpha-Stacker

### Description:
> Create a stackLetters function that should console.log() rows of letters. It should take an array containing the letters of the alphabet and output them in the developer console.

> Then add logic to stackLetters that places a space after every third letter. This will require you to do some basic math in JavaScript, and use an if statement.

*Your job is to read the following English statement and write the equivalent in JavaSript code to make it work.

If the current value of the counter variable can be evenly divided by 3 - using the JavaScript remainder operator - then add a single space to the output.

### Final Result:
> Demonstrates basic function writing and conditional statements involving modulus use in loops and console logs.
